     <h2>About Pediatric Service</h2> </div>
     <div class="text">
      <div class="text1"><h4>What is urgent care?</h4>
       <p>Urgent care is medical care for acute illnesses and injuries and minor emergencies. It is not suitable for life threatening conditions such as if your child is unresponsive, or struggling to breathe.
        Urgent care services are appropriate if it’s not a life threatening condition, but can’t wait until tomorrow.</p>
      </div> 
        <div class="text2">  
         <h4>How do I know I’m getting good advice?</h4>
           <p>All our Pediatric Service maintain current positions in children’s hospitals. They are at the front lines – dealing with the most complex and difficult cases on a daily basis. All have 7 years specialist training in paediatric emergency medicine, and have treated thousands of children for every conceivable illness and injury.</p>
        </div> 
         <div class="text3">
           <h4>Does Pediatric Service replace my GP?</h4>
           <p>Pediatric Service is an on-demand specialist service and is not intended to replace your GP. Pediatric Service can complement the care provided by your GP, and we recommend your family has a GP for ongoing care.</p>

       <div class="text1">
         <h4>What happens if it’s a medical emergency?</h4>
         <p>Pediatric Service is not an emergency service. If it is a medical emergency – please call 000 immediately. If our Pediatric Service™ deem it an emergency, we will tell you immediately. You will not be charged for the call if you do not want us to stay on the line.</p>
       </div> 
        <div class="text2">  
         <h4>Can I claim a Medicare rebate?</h4>
          <p>Rebates are available for all calls between 11pm and 7am, and for children < 12 months of age. Please note, Medicare rebates are subject to change, and gap payments may still exist. </p>
        </div> 
        <div class="text3">
          <h4>Can I use Pediatric Service when overseas?</h4>
          <p>Unfortunately, our insurance won’t cover calls from overseas at this point. We suggest you call local emergency services if urgent medical care is required.

        <div class="text1">
         <h4>How do I request a call?</h4>
         <p>By using our web-based app, just hit the 'See a Pediatric Service' button. Then you will need to sign up your family, if you haven’t already. Whilst waiting, make sure you fill in as much detail as possible to assist the doctor in getting to the heart of your consultation.</p> 
        </div> 
       <div class="text2">  
         <h4>How long will it take to be called back?</h4>
         <p>Our commitment is to provide a timely service. Our aim for members is to respond to your request within 60min, and for non-members within 120mins. While we make every effort to get to all calls as quickly as possible, it is possible that, during very busy periods, you may experience longer than usual waiting times.</p>

    <h2>During the Consult</h2>
   </div>
    <div class="text" > 
     <div class="text1">
       <h4>What happens in a consult?</h4>
        <p color>Just as in a surgery, the doctor will talk with you about the health issue. After this, a virtual examination will take place. We believe at Pediatric Service that video is essential for us to make an accurate assessment.
                The Doctor will then give you advice about what they think is going on, and what to do next. This might be staying at home and continuing to look after your child, accessing immediate medical care, seeing your GP for follow up, or even calling an ambulance.</p>
     </div> 
     <div class="text2">  
       <h4>Prescriptions, Referrals and Medical Certificates</h4>
        <p>Pediatric Service can provide referrals and medical certificates directly to you as PDF files to be printed as required. Prescriptions will be sent directly to your local pharmacy where you can pick up any required medications.*Restricted medications may not be provided</p>

     <div class="text1">
       <h4>What happens if my Pediatric Service says I need a face to face consultation?</h4>
         <p>Although Telehealth offers a convenient way to see an expert doctor, sometimes a face-to-face consult with a GP or other specialist is required. Our aim is to keep you home, safe and sound, but if it looks like something needs further investigation or attention, we will refer you to the best place for follow up</p>
     </div> 
     <div class="text2">  
       <h4>Do I have access to my information?</h4>
        <p>Yes – a consult summary will be sent to you after every consultation. To avoid sharing personal information via email, this will be available for you to download through the app.</p>
     </div> 
      <div class="text3">
       <h4>Can Pediatric Service share information with my family GP?</h4>
         <p>Yes – with your consent, we are able to share information from the consult with your GP.</p>

         <h4>What if my internet connection isn’t good enough?</h4>
            <p>Currently Pediatric Service requires a stable internet connection. If video is not possible with your available bandwidth, the consult can be made via audio. You can supplement audio consults with photos or pre-recorded videos whilst you are waiting for your Pediatric Service™ to call back.</p>
       </div> 
          <div class="text2">  
            <h4>What happens if my call cuts out?</h4>
            <p>If the connection cuts out unexpectedly, we will attempt to re-establish the connection. If we can’t get back in touch, and you’ve been on the consult less than 5 minutes, you won’t be charged.</p>
